## Overview
This Project is being created to convey the stories of the local Aboriginal community in a way that is more interesting for school children.

The Game is being made for Courses SGD304 & 305 at the University of the Sunshine Coast.

## Production
The team formed in April of 2018 and spent 3 months prototyping the mechanics in conjunction with communication with a representative of the Sunshine Coast Aboriginal Community.

In the second half of 2018 the team set to create the completed game in time for USC's Games Showcase on the 15th of November, 2018.

The Game is made in the Unity Engine.
